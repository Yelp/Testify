"""Mocking and Stubbing framework

This framework is built around the 'Turtle' object. A Turtle object returns another turtle for every 
unknown (not predefined) attributed asked for. It is also callable, returning (of course) a turtle.

After a turtle is used, it can be inspected to find out what happened:

  >>> leonardo = turtle.Turtle()
  >>> leonardo.color = "blue"
  >>> leonardo.attack(weapon="katanas")
  <testify.utils.turtle.Turtle object at 0x7fbd01e67dd0>

  >>> leonardo.do_katanas.calls
  [[((), {'weapon': katanas})]]

To control the behavior of a turtle (for example, if you want some function to call to return None instead)
just set the attribute yourself

  >>> raphael = Turtle()
  >>> raphael.color = "red"
  >>> raphael.is_lame = lambda : False

Then you can call:
  if raphael.color is None or raphael.is_lame():
      <do stuff>
