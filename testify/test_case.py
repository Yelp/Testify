    """The TestCase class defines test methods and fixture methods; it is the meat and potatoes of testing.

    QuickStart:
        define a test method, instantiate an instance and call test_case.run()

    Extended information:
        TestCases can contain any number of test methods, as well as class-level
        setup/teardown methods and setup/teardowns to be wrapped around each test
        method. These are defined by decorators.

        The phases of execution are thus:
        class_setup
            setup
                test_method_1
            teardown
            setup
                test_method_2
            teardown
        class_teardown

        The results of test methods are stored in TestResult objects.

        Additional behavior beyond running tests, such as logging results, is achieved
        by registered callbacks.  For more information see the docstrings for:
            register_on_complete_test_method_callback
